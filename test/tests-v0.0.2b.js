 *
 *  Abstract Data [ Model @ Graph ]
 *
 *  -   [ Entities @ Addresses @ Predicates ] which are spatio-temporally Discrete
 *
 *      1.  Data as [ Nodes @ Vertices ]
 *
 *      2.  [ Dependencies @ Causalities ] 
 *              as [ Arrows @ Directed Edges] between Datum
 *
 *          -   The following expressions are (roughly) equivalent:
 *
 *              -   'Y depends on X' 
 *              -   'X determines Y' 
 *              -   'X supervenes on Y' 
 *              -   'there is an arrow from X to Y' 
 *              -   'changes in X, cause changes in Y' 
 *              -
 *              -   'there is a causal function, F, from X to Y'
 *                      (X is its domain, and Y its codomain)
 *
 *              -   'changes in X, imply changes in Y'
 *              -   'a change in X, necessitates an update of Y'
 *                      (this update may, or may not, 
                        result in the same value of Y)
 *
 *          -   The following expressions are (roughly) equivalent:
 *
 *              -   'A is equivalent to B' 
 *              -   'there is a two-way dependency, between A and B'
 *              -   'there are two opposing arrows, between A and B'
 *              -   'a change in A necessites an update of B, and, 
 *                      a change in B necessitates an update of A'
 *
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *  -   Existential Quantification of a Discrete Entity.
 *
 *      1.  [ Creation @ Existentialisation ]
 *
 *      2.  [ Deletion @ Uncreation @ Destruction]
 *
 *  -   [ Qualifying @ Copying ] Operations may be performed,
 *          only between two Entities which Exist
 *
 *      3a. [ Reading @ Evaluation @ Getting ] is a copying of values,
 *              from a remote Address (typically a Machine), 
 *              to a local Address (typically a User).
 *
 *      3b. [ Updating @ Writing @ Setting @ Modifying ] is a copying of values,
 *              from a local Address (typically a User),
 *              to a remote Address (typically a Machine).
 *
 *  -   The acronym, CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete), is conventional.
 *  
 *  -   Reading and Updating are basically the same operation, 
 *          but in different directions.
 *
 *  -   Given two types of Entity, and three types of event, we should need
 *          six ( 6 = 2 * 3 ) blocks of code to implement this model.
 *          Additionally, we have to pipe the Qualifying Operation to two sets
 *          of syntax, respectively for 3a. and 3b.
